## üî¨ Main Projects

### 1. **Soybean Expression Atlas V2**  
A large-scale compendium of publicly available RNA-Seq data from soybean, with more than 5,000 samples (up from 1,298 in version 1), organized by tissue. Provides both normalized expression values (TPM) and raw read counts.  

### 2. **SoyPestGCN**  
An R package with a Shiny web interface for exploring co-expression gene networks in soybean tissues under insect stress.

### 3. **SoyFungiGCN**  
An R package with a Shiny interface for exploring co-expression networks in soybean tissues infected by fungal phytopathogens.

### 4. **BioNERO**  
A comprehensive R/Bioconductor package that integrates multiple gene network analyses ‚Äî including preprocessing, regulatory and co-expression network inference, functional analysis, and intra/inter-species comparisons.
